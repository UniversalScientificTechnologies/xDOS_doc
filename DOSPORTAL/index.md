# DOSPORTAL

## Introduction

DOSPORTAL is an innovative cloud-based tool developed by UST, designed to facilitate the visualization and management of logs from particle detectors. This documentation is intended for all users of DOSPORTAL, ranging from technicians and scientists working with particle detectors to IT professionals responsible for system integration and management. Our goal is to provide you with a comprehensive guide that will enable you to fully leverage all the features and capabilities that DOSPORTAL offers.

DOSPORTAL is primarily designed for use with UST's particle detectors: LABDOS, AIRDOS, and GEODOS. You can learn more about these detectors in other sections of this documentation or on the official website.
