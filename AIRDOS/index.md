In civil aviation, measuring cosmic radiation is a main use of AIRDOS detectors. Cosmic radiation, more intense at high altitudes, poses a risk to health of flight crews and passengers. The AIRDOS series helps in monitoring and managing this exposure, ensuring safety and health during flights.

The measurement of radiation dose acquired during flights by aircraft crews is a requirement mandated by legislation in some countries. The AIRDOS detectors from UST are equipped to provide this essential measurement, ensuring compliance with these regulatory needs.
