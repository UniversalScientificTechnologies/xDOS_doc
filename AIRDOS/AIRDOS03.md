# AIRDOS03 - UAV compatible dosimeter and spectrometer

AIRDOS03, also called “UAVDOS”, is a semiconductor detector developed in cooperation with [ThunderFly s.r.o.](https://docs.thunderfly.cz/avionics/AIRDOS03/) as a measuring device for the [TF-ATMON](https://www.thunderfly.cz/tf-atmon.html) system. The detector is designed to be lightweight and capable of connecting to the drone’s avionics. It meets the requirements for TF-ATMON’s sensors and therefore can share a power supply, data storage, or telemetry link with common drone avionics. This eliminates excess weight that would otherwise have to be carried by the detector, thereby decreasing the flight range and lowering drone parameters. The particle detector is, at the same time, compatible with the [Pixhawk](https://www.pixhawk.org/) standard for connecting devices to drones. “UAVDOS” is thus compatible with a large number of existing drones.

The [TF-ATMON](https://www.thunderfly.cz/tf-atmon.html) system, in combination with the sensor, enables the search for areas with increased radiation intensity and optimally utilizes flight time to collect high-quality data.
