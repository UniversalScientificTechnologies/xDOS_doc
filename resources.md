### SD Card Preparation for xDOS Devices (AIRDOS, SPACEDOS, GEODOS)

To ensure optimal performance and compatibility with xDOS devices (AIRDOS, SPACEDOS, and GEODOS), it is necessary to format the SD card by overwriting all sectors with zeros. This step guarantees that no residual data remains on the card, which could interfere with the systemâ€™s operation or possible data recovery attempts.

You can use the provided script to properly format the SD card: [Format SD Script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UniversalScientificTechnologies/SPACEDOS03/refs/heads/SPACEDOS03A/scripts/formatsd.sh).

Please follow the instructions in the script to make sure the card is correctly prepared for use on your device.
