The SPACEDOS solid-state dosimeter series is suitable for extreme radiation conditions of space missions. Silicon semiconductor deposited energy spectrometer technology has outstanding sensitivity to charged particles, which are the main and the most dangerous part of the primary cosmic ray. 
It comes in two variants: one for manned and one for unmanned missions, differing mainly in their interfaces. The manned mission variant is a smarter equivalent of a passive dosimeter that can be used by astronauts while the unmanned version can be integrated into spacecraft systems like satellites. Both options require only a minimum power.  Both types prioritize safety and reliability, with a power supply based on onboard sources or chemical cells, depending on the mission type. Theyâ€™re designed for single-mission use, able to operate without maintenance.
