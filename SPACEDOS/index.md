The SPACEDOS dosimeter series is suitable for extreme radiation conditions of space missions. It comes in two variants: one for manned and one for unmanned missions, differing mainly in their interfaces. The manned mission variant is a smarter equivalent of a passive dosimeter that can be used by astronauts while the unmanned version can be integrated into spacecraft systems like satellites. Both options require only a minimum power.  Both types prioritize safety and reliability, with a power supply based on onboard sources or chemical cells, depending on the mission type. Theyâ€™re designed for single-mission use, able to operate without maintenance.

The overview of SPACEDOS variants:

  * [SPACEDOS01](/spacedos/SPACEDOS01) - Unmanned missions onboard small satellites (CubeSats)
  * SPACEDOS02 - Manned missions, LEO/MEO orbits
  * SPACEDOS03 - Manned missions, radiation shielding material testing.
