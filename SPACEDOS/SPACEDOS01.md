# SPACEDOS01 Cosmic-ray spectrometer and dosimeter for unmanned spacecraft missions

SPACEDOS01 is an ionizing radiation energy spectrometer based on a semiconductor detector using a PIN diode. The detector is optimized for mounting and long-term use on the board of CubeSat, meaning that its power consumption is minimized and it is constructed to withstand conditions in space.

SPACEDOS01 exists in two hardware variants:

  * SPACEDOS01A -engineering model compatible with MLAB kit system
  * SPACEDOS01B - with a shape adjusted for mounting in CubeSat satellites.

In the case of manned missions, we suggest to use SPACEDOS02 or SPACEDOS03.
