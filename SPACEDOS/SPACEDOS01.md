# SPACEDOS01 Cosmic-ray spectrometer and dosimeter for unmanned spacecraft missions

SPACEDOS01 is an ionizing radiation energy spectrometer based on a semiconductor detector using a PIN diode. The detector is optimized for mounting and long-term use on the board of CubeSat, meaning that its power consumption is minimized and it is constructed to withstand conditions in space.

SPACEDOS01 exists in two hardware variants:

  * [SPACEDOS01A](./SPACEDOS01A.md) - Engineering model compatible with MLAB kit system
  * [SPACEDOS01B](./SPACEDOS01B.md) - Space qualified and shape adjusted for the use in CubeSat satellites.

SPACEDOS's primary applications are radiation alarm devices for satellite FCS and scientific research instruments for cosmic rays.   

In the case of manned missions, we suggest to use [SPACEDOS02](./SPACEDOS02.md) or [SPACEDOS03](./SPCAEDOS03.md).
