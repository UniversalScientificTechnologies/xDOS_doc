# UST Detectors Output Format

This document describes the output file format for the AIRDOS and LABDOS series of particle detectors. The file is formatted in plain text, which not only facilitates easy readability by humans but also allows for quick and efficient machine parsing. This format is particularly designed to accommodate multiple logs (detector cycles) within a single file, enabling these logs to be segmented into individual logs for detailed analysis. The current version of this file format is actively in use.


# Version 1

## File Structure

The output file is composed of various data messages, each representing different types of data captured by the detector. The structure of these lines is adopted from [NMEA 0183](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183). The messages are stored in a file or transmitted on the UART port. Typically, the baud rate used is 9600 with 8 databits and one stop bit. Handshake is not applicable.

```
- **Format**: `$HIST, [message number], [time], [detected particles], [], [], [], [], [Channel 1], [Channel 2], ...`
- **Description**: A detailed histogram representing the distribution of detected events or measurements across various categories.

### Battery status
```
$BATT,6,63.58,227,0,0,975,20.25
```

### Environment data

Information about temperature, humidity, and pressure.

```
$ENV,30,309.39,23.8,45.0,24.7,44.3,23.72,984.81
```

## Notes

- The plain text file format ensures compatibility and ease of parsing for both humans and machines.
- This format is currently in use and represents the latest data output in UST detectors.
- Each line type in the file serves a specific purpose in capturing and representing data from the particle detector.


# Version 1.5

## File Structure

The output file is composed of various data messages, each representing different types of data captured by the detector. The structure of these lines is as follows:

## Example:

# Version 2

Version 2 is used by AIRDOS04C and is specified in detail in [FW repository](https://github.com/UniversalScientificTechnologies/AIRDOS04/blob/AIRDOS04C/fw/AIRDOS04/OUTPUT_FORMAT.md)).

Each record is one text line. Data lines start with `$` and use comma-separated fields. Lines are terminated by newline (`\n`); within measurement blocks the firmware may use `\r\n`.

## Message types

The v2 stream can be viewed as three groups:

- **Header messages**: emitted once at the beginning of the file. They describe *what device produced the data*.
- **Particle messages**: the actual radiation/event payload, emitted repeatedly in fixed integration blocks (uasually 10 s). A block starts with `$START`, may contain many `$E` lines, and ends with `$STOP`.
- **Status messages**: emitted on a lower frequenty (or on specific service events). They carry environmental readings, battery health, and RTC/service state.


## Header messages

#### `$DOS` — device identification
- **When**: once at the beginning of the file (startup header)
- **Meaning**: identifies device type (`AIRDOS04C`), firmware/build info and Git hash, and the analog board serial number.
- **Format**:

```
$DOS,<TYPE>,<FWversion>,0,<git_hash>,<build_type>,<serial_analog_16B_hex>
```

- **Example**:

```
$DOS,AIRDOS04C,2.0.0-0-User,0,a3e23b543a4de5dc3d057462bb6109bf3db0b44b,User,0910410874100851c40ba080a08000b3
```

#### `$DIG` — digital module identification
- **When**: once at the beginning of the file
- **Meaning**: identifies the digital board (`BATDATUNIT01B`), its serial number and configuration bytes.
- **Format**:

```
$DIG,<DIGTYPE>,<serial_digital_16B_hex>,<DIG_EEPROM>
```

- **Example**:

```
$DIG,BATDATUNIT01B,09104108741008520c0ca080a080005e,ffff
```

#### `$ADC` — analog module identification
- **When**: once at the beginning of the file
- **Meaning**: identifies the analog front-end board (`USTSIPIN03A`), its serial number and ADC configuration bytes.
- **Format**:

```
$ADC,<ADC_NAME>,<serial_analog_16B_hex>,<ADC_EEPROM>
```

- **Example**:

```
$ADC,USTSIPIN03A,0910410874100851c40ba080a08000b3,ffff
```

#### `$BATP` — battery presence
- **When**: once at the beginning of the file
- **Meaning**: reports whether a battery was detected at startup and the measured battery voltage (mV).
- **Format**:

```
$BATP,<present>,<battery_mV>
```

- **Example**:

```
$BATP,1,4150
```

#### `$TIME` — time and synchronization info
- **When**: once at the beginning of the file
- **Meaning**: provides RTC seconds, last synchronization time stored in EEPROM, computed current Unix time, sync age, and human-readable UTC timestamp.
- **Format**:

```
$TIME,<rtc_seconds>,<eeprom_sync_time>,<current_unix_time>,<sync_age>,<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS>
```

- **Example**:

```
$TIME,1234567,1708862400,1708863634,0,2025-02-25 14:30:34
```


## Particle messages (integration block)

#### `$START` — start of integration block
- **When**: every integration period (nominally every 10 s)
- **Meaning**: marks start of a measurement block (integration window) and provides the reference system timer value.
- **Format**:

```
$START,<count>,<event_time_0>
```

- **Example**:

```
$START,0,1
```

#### `$E` — single above-threshold event
- **When**: zero or more times within an integration block
- **Meaning**: one line per event above threshold, with event time (in ticks) and the raw ADC value (used to classify the event).
- **Format**:

```
$E,<long_event_time>,<event_channel>
```

- **Example**:

```
$E,488,24
```

#### `$STOP` — end of integration block
- **When**: every integration period, after the block’s `$E` lines
- **Meaning**: closes the measurement block and reports end time, total number of above-threshold events, and the histogram counters for energy channels.
- **Format**:

```
$STOP,<count>,<tm>.<tm_s100>,<systime>,<events_count>,<histogram_0>,<histogram_1>,<histogram_2>,<histogram_3>
```

- **Example**:

```
$STOP,179,4275399681.0,31359,427,19373,11,24,7
```

## Status messages

#### `$RTCCHK` — RTC check / initialization status
- **When**: on RTC check / (re)initialization (typically at startup or when needed)
- **Meaning**: records whether RTC settings were OK or had to be initialized, including selected RTC register values.
- **Format**:

```
$RTCCHK,<tm>.<tm_s100>,(OK|INIT),reg07=0x<hex>,reg28=0x<hex>
```

- **Example**:

```
$RTCCHK,1234567.50,OK,reg07=0x00,reg28=0x97
```

#### `$ENV` — environmental sensors
- **When**: periodically (every ~5 minutes)
- **Meaning**: temperatures and humidities from two sensors plus temperature and pressure from a pressure sensor.
- **Format**:

```
$ENV,<count>,<tm>.<tm_s100>,<T1>,<H1>,<T2>,<H2>,<T_MS5611>,<P_MS5611>
```

- **Example**:

```
$ENV,179,4275399683.0,29.1,44.0,27.5,45.5,29.31,989.05
```

#### `$BATT` — battery status
- **When**: periodically (every ~30 minutes)
- **Meaning**: battery voltage/current/capacity/temperature values from the fuel gauge.
- **Format**:

```
$BATT,<count>,<tm>.<tm_s100>,<voltage_mV>,<current_mA>,<remaining_mAh>,<full_charge_mAh>,<temperature_C>
```

- **Example**:

```
$BATT,720,12345.50,4150,-120,1800,2000,25.3
```

## Notes
- Lines starting with `#` are debug/service messages (typically on the debug serial port) and are not part of the data stream.
