LABDOS01 is a lightweight portable ionizing radiation spectrometer-dosimeter intended as an experimental device for laboratory measurements or as a personal dosimeter for frequent flyers. The dosimeter is connected via a USB bus, through which it is powered and read-out. This minimizes the demand for skills required to operate the dosimeter.
