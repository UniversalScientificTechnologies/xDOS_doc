LABDOS01 is a lightweight portable dosimeter intended as an experimental device for laboratory measurements. The dosimeter is connected via a USB bus, through which it is powered and read-out. This minimizes the demand for skills required to operate the dosimeter.

This device should be used for experimental verification and planning before using our more sophisticated and application-specific devices like SPACEDOS, AIRDOS or GEODOS.
