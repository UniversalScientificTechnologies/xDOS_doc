GEODOS is series of ionizing radiation detectors suitable for ground-based applications, both mobile and stationary. It can detect radiation occurring on the Earth's surface, typically using a scintillation detector. It has relatively low requirements for low power consumption since there is usually sufficient power available (solar or station-socket-based). High reliability is essential as it operates as a standalone device without supervision, with a service interval of approximately six months, primarily for memory media replacement.
